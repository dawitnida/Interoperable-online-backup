# Interoperable-online-backup

The main objective of this project is to design and implement interoperable online backup software initiated by Green spot company. 
In addition, this documentation focuses on establishing funda-mental background and research to create a cross platform application using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) (Microsoft's .NET Framework) on Linux platform. The software was developed using Mono development framework and Linux shell scripting based on standard software development life cycle.

This application uses client-server par-adigm, in which suitable compliers, MySQL and Apache programs were installed and con-figured. To achieve multiple users to backup simultaneously, an asynchronous communica-tion method was implemented. Furthermore, it was deployed and tested on Windows 7 platform. As a result, multiple clients were allowed to access the host, create new backups and store data on the remote server concurrently. Besides, the application was analyzed using the Mono Migration Analyzer (MoMA) tool for porting to Linux. 

In result to, some of the class libraries were found missing. The application can be further developed to support different platforms, such as smart phones, tablets, MacOSx, Linux distribution and also make new provision and customization to build a web-based application. Moreover, it can be opti-mized by allocating bandwidth limit and upgraded to provide additional features.
